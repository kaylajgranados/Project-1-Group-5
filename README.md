In our project, we wanted to analyze how dense urban areas stack up to richer suburban areas in terms of bringing the city revenue. Our hypothesis for this project was that highly populated, dense areas will bring the city more revenue than suburbs. Our reasoning is that, with so many people in one area, there would be more economic output with a conglomeration of businesses/ high-rise residential areas.

Firstly, we took a few city examples to compare total revenue. We chose the three cities with the largest urban areas and compared them each with a suburban city in the county it is located. Based off our findings, the urban areas made a total revenue greater than suburbia. We suspect that this trend may be similar in comparison to the other urban and suburban areas in the state.

Next, using the data available, we separated generated tax revenue into three distinct categories and totaled the taxes for those categories: property taxes, business taxes, and miscellaneous taxes. Based on the outputs, we concluded that urban areas collect more taxes than suburban areas across all three categories. We additionally compared the sum, mean, and median of the total taxes, which again supported out conclusion that urban areas generate more revenue than suburban areas. Out of the three tax categories, property taxes produced more revenue for both cities and suburbs than business or miscellaneous taxes. Los Angeles produced the highest total of taxes across all categories.    

Next, we wanted to look outside of a few cities and see if there is an overall correlation between density and a higher revenue across cities in California. First, we checked the p-values for total population, density, and revenue per capita with a normal test to confirm they are all statistically significant. Once confirmed, we found the correlation value between :
1. Total population and Revenue: We expected and observed a strong positive correlation between the two, meaning the more populated a city, the more likely it will collect higher revenue.
2. Density and Revenue: Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the data did not show a strong correlation between density and revenue. Just because an area is more dense, does not mean it will necessarily collect more money than a city of similar population and less density. 
3. Density and Per Capita Revenue: Finally, we observed that density also does not seem to strongly affect money generated per person in the area.

Overall, while a few dense cities made more money than their less populated counterparts, we found that revenue is related to total population, not density. Any further studies with this information would take in other factors about a city (industries, education, etc.) to find if any of those more directly impact generated city revenue, since density alone can be ruled out.
